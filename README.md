# 🌍 Marovi Manifestos

**Empowering Language Communities in the Age of AI**

Marovi is building open-source infrastructure to help every country and language community **evaluate, improve, and take ownership of the LLMs and translation systems** that shape how their language is represented in AI.

This repository contains the foundational principles of that effort — including our governance model and international manifesto — and invites contributors to join the mission of building truly multilingual AI from the ground up.

---

## 📜 Manifestos

- 🌐 [Marovi International Manifesto](./INTERNATIONAL.md)

The manifesto outlines our vision for open, collaborative, and community-powered language infrastructure — where anyone can participate in improving the AI systems that affect their language.

---

## 🏛 Governance

- 🔐 [Governance Philosophy](./GOVERNANCE.md)

Marovi is community-powered but centrally stewarded.  
We maintain the roadmap, infrastructure, and benchmarks — while empowering contributors to lead language-specific efforts, propose corrections, and build the best open-source tools for their region.

---

## 💬 What’s Coming

We're building toward:
- Community-led manifestos for individual languages and regions
- Open benchmarks comparing LLMs and translation systems in every major language
- Tools for glossary curation, correction feedback, and QA-driven evaluation
- A shared model repository for community-improved pipelines and weights

---

## 🤝 Contribute

- Want to co-own the future of multilingual AI in your language  
- Have ideas about benchmarking or glossary quality
