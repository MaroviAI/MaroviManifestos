# 🌍 Marovi Manifestos

**Empowering Language Communities in the Age of AI**

Marovi is building open infrastructure to give every country and language community the ability to **evaluate, improve, and control the LLMs and translation systems** that shape how their language is used in AI.

This repository houses the foundational vision of that effort:  
a shared commitment to **linguistic sovereignty**, **transparency**, and **collaboration** in the multilingual AI era.
