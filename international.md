# 🌍 Marovi International Manifesto

## Building Language Sovereignty in the Age of AI

---

### Why We Exist

Modern AI systems—LLMs and translation models—are powerful, but they are optimized for **English, centralization, and opacity**.

Languages with fewer speakers, less training data, or more cultural nuance are being left behind or misrepresented by:

- Black-box models
- Uncontrolled translations
- Poor reasoning fidelity
- Lack of national or cultural ownership

**Marovi exists to change that.**

---

### Our Mission

> To empower every country and language community to **evaluate, improve, and deploy the best AI language models** for their people—through open-source tools, transparent benchmarks, and collaborative infrastructure.

---

- Help define what “correct” means—**on your own terms**

#### ✅ 4. Hostability and Sovereignty
- Self-hostable or cloud-hosted infrastructure for:
  - Local governments
  - Universities

### We Believe...

🌐 Every language deserves its own LLM evaluation report  
📚 Every glossary should be human-approved, transparent, and updatable  
🧠 Every correction should be reusable training signal  
🗳️ Every community should have a say in how their language is modeled  
🛠️ And every pipeline should be open, reproducible, and buildable by anyone
