# 🌍 Marovi International Manifesto

## Building Language Sovereignty in the Age of AI

---

### Why We Exist

Modern AI systems — from translation engines to general-purpose LLMs — are powerful, but they are optimized for **English, centralization, and opacity**.

Languages with fewer speakers, less training data, or more cultural nuance are often left behind or misrepresented by:

- Black-box models
- Inconsistent or tone-deaf translations
- Gaps in reasoning across languages
- Lack of local participation in model development

**Marovi exists to change that.**

---

### Our Mission

> To help every country and language community **evaluate, improve, and deploy their own multilingual AI infrastructure** — using open-source tools, public benchmarks, and community-powered collaboration.

---

### What We Provide

#### ✅ 1. Open Benchmarks for Every Language
- Evaluate how well top models work in your language
- Break down performance by domain: legal, research, conversation, etc.
- Access raw test data, outputs, and correction logs

#### ✅ 2. Transparent, Reproducible Pipelines
- Open-source translation and refinement pipelines
- Glossary injection, tone controls, and eval modules
- Built to be forked, audited, improved

#### ✅ 3. Community Participation Tools
- Propose or vote on glossary terms
- Log corrections and glossary mismatches
- Help tune, test, or even train better models for your language

#### ✅ 4. Self-Hosting and Sovereignty Options
- Deployable infrastructure for universities, labs, or governments
- Support for localized pipelines, glossaries, and corpora
- Interfaces to improve or override central models with local feedback

### We Believe...

🌐 Every language deserves transparent LLM evaluations  
📚 Every glossary should reflect community input  
🧠 Every correction is a training signal  
🗳️ Communities should help define what “correct” means in context  
🛠️ And every language should have access to open infrastructure — not just English
