# 🔐 Marovi Governance Philosophy

**Marovi is an open-source, multilingual AI infrastructure project — but it is not decentralized.**  
We believe in open collaboration, language sovereignty, and empowering communities to improve AI in their language — while maintaining a unified, trusted platform for global deployment.

## ✅ What Marovi Owns and Maintains

- The **Marovi brand**, product vision, and global roadmap  
- Core repositories: `MaroviPipelines`, `MaroviWeb`, `MaroviInternal`  
- The hosted **Marovi SaaS platform**, including:  
  - Pro tools and gated features  
  - API access for translation, refinement, and benchmarking  
  - Correction + glossary management systems  
- The official **benchmark formats**, eval tooling, and integration specs  
- Any globally hosted glossary/correction corpora unless otherwise licensed

## 🌍 What Communities Can Build Together

Marovi is a platform that **enables language communities to co-develop their own open-source AI infrastructure** — including:

- Evaluating and documenting the **best LLMs and translators** for their language  
- Hosting **open benchmarks** and sharing raw evaluation data  
- Contributing corrections and glossary terms to refine outputs  
- Collaboratively fine-tuning open-source models or training new ones  
- Building their **own sovereign stacks** — with open weights, prompts, and pipelines

> In this sense, Marovi is like Hugging Face — but focused specifically on translation, multilingual reasoning, correction tracking, and glossary control.

---

## 🧠 Contribution ≠ Control

- All contributions are **reviewed and curated by the Marovi team**  
- Communities can **propose, maintain, and lead language-specific efforts**  
- The Marovi team ensures code, benchmarks, and brand consistency  
- Forks are welcome, but **the Marovi name is centrally governed**

---

## 💬 A Shared Model, Not a Centralized One

Marovi provides:
- Reproducible pipelines and open benchmarks  
- A stable API and extensible architecture  
- Transparent governance for language data

But each language community can:
- Define what “correct” means for their use cases  
- Submit their best models, weights, and pipelines  
- Improve or replace open-source baselines over time  
- Co-own the benchmark results, corrections, and preferred stack

---

## 💰 Why This Still Enables Revenue

This open approach allows:
- Public collaboration + contribution
- Transparent benchmarking
- Private SaaS monetization through hosting, support, and enhanced tools

> Marovi aims to be the trusted infrastructure for multilingual AI — **owned publicly, stewarded responsibly, and delivered commercially.**
