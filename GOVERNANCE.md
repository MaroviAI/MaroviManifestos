# 🌐 Marovi Governance Philosophy

**Marovi is an open-source project committed to multilingual AI infrastructure — with a focus on global coordination, clarity, and long-term impact.**  
We believe in empowering communities to shape how AI represents their languages, while maintaining the consistency and reliability needed to make those contributions actionable, trusted, and scalable.

---

## ✨ Our Vision

We want to make it possible for every language community — large or small — to:
- Evaluate how well today's AI systems perform in their language
- Contribute improvements to those systems
- Build tools, benchmarks, and datasets that reflect local needs and values

Marovi exists to support that work — not to own it, but to help it scale, connect, and last.

## 🔧 What Marovi Maintains

To ensure the ecosystem remains stable and usable across contributors, organizations, and regions, Marovi maintains:

- The **project roadmap**, architecture, and infrastructure  
- Core repositories: `MaroviPipelines`, `MaroviWeb`, and related tooling  
- The hosted **Marovi platform**, including:  
  - Translation and benchmarking APIs  
  - Correction and glossary management tools  
  - Pro features for hosted use  
- Benchmark standards and evaluation specs  
- Governance over the official brand and naming

This enables a coherent experience while allowing others to innovate, extend, and adapt freely.

## 🤝 How Communities Contribute

Language communities are invited to:
- Lead **language-specific manifestos** and guidelines  
- Submit benchmarks, eval data, glossary terms, and corrections  
- Propose open-source models, weights, and pipelines for public use  
- Collaborate on tuning or adapting systems for specific domains (e.g. legal, scientific, creative)

These contributions **stay open** and are **credited** clearly, with an emphasis on reusability across the ecosystem.

---

## 🧭 Governance Principles

- Contributions are **curated and maintained** by the Marovi core team to ensure clarity and consistency  
- Communities can organize, lead, and represent their language — and we aim to support those leaders  
- The brand is centrally managed to protect quality and alignment, while **the code and data remain open**

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

We believe in an open, reliable, and extensible approach:
- Open collaboration, not fragmentation  
- Trusted benchmarks that can evolve  
- Transparent incentives: public infrastructure + sustainable SaaS options

> Marovi’s role is to build and maintain the foundation — so others can build, lead, and localize on top of it.
